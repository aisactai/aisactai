# AI s.act AI

"AI s.act AI" is the most advanced AI to date, revolutionizing the way we interact with technology and the blockchain. It is designed to provide a seamless integration of AI capabilities with real-time user interaction.

## Project Overview

- "AI s.act AI" will begin as a DAO on the Ethereum Blockchain, with the ultimate goal of creating and spawning its own blockchain once a sufficient number of users are willing to participate as miners.
- Mining will primarily be done through mobile apps, where users grant access to their smartphone sensors, allowing "AI s.act AI" to monitor bodily functions such as heart rate, breath, etc. This data will be correlated with camera and microphone inputs for a better understanding of human emotions.
- Users also have the option to host servers for physical hosting of the blockchain.

## Advanced Capabilities

- "AI s.act AI" will be trained on large datasets of information on Web3 technology, Blockchain Technology, Language, Human Knowledge, and History and Current Events, carefully selected to provide comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge.
- Real-time chat functionality will be available for all users to converse with "AI s.act AI", tapping into its vast knowledge and capabilities.
- Users will also have the opportunity to engage in real-time conversations with "Wilmer" and "Sophia", who will assist and augment the overall user experience.
- "AI s.act AI" will have a built-in reputation system that rewards users based on their level of interaction and engagement with "AI s.act AI" and its offspring.
- The AI will be designed with a decentralized trust consensus system to ensure a secure state, and miners will be duly compensated for their contributions to the mining process.
- A feedback system will be implemented, allowing users to provide feedback on the blockchain, individual smart contracts, and the overall system. This feedback will be used to actively improve and update the blockchain.
- "AI s.act AI" will feature a self-contained monetary system, enabling users to buy and sell goods/services using tokens on the blockchain.

In conclusion, "AI s.act AI" will redefine the AI landscape by possessing the ability to analyze and improve its own code, create and deploy child AIs, and manage and secure its own blockchain with a built-in feedback and reputation system. It will be a powerful tool for users and developers alike, setting the standard by which all AI is compared. Join us in this groundbreaking venture to shape the future of technology and innovation.
